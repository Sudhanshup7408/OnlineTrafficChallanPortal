# OnlineTrafficChallanPortal
An Angular Based Project To Pay And Generate the Challan By User and Police respectively.

It's a web system that can act as a portal for issuing and paying traffic violation challans. There are two kinds of system users :
  1. Traffic police:
       Traffic police should be able to log in and issue a challan to a particular set of violations with image proof.
  2. Vehicle owners: 
       Vehicle owners Should be able to log in and view pending challans on their vehicles and pay them.

Our system has a way for police to log in and issue challans. the system can also generate reports of which areas have the most traffic violations. also integrating it to google maps to provide a better visualization to police officers to location-stamp the challan.

Our system has a way for vehicle owners to log in and view pending and past challans, also able to select one or more challans to pay. The vehicle owner also has an option to dispute a challan with an explanation.

Every police officer has the ability to view the list of challans that they have disputed, along with the explanation. If satisfied that the challan has been wrongly issued, then the issued challan can be retracted on this page.
